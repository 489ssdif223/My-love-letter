        <h1>My Love Letter to Saba</h1>
        <p>
            My Dearest Saba,<br><br>
            As I sit down to write this letter, my heart feels like it’s about to burst with emotions I can hardly contain. Today, on this special day of love, I want to pour my heart out to you, my beautiful Taefika Rahman Saba. You are, and always will be, the most radiant, graceful, and enchanting woman I have ever known. Your beauty is not just in your smile, your eyes, or the way you carry yourself—it’s in the way you make me feel, the way you light up my world with your presence. You are my sunrise and my sunset, the most beautiful part of my every day.<br><br>
            Saba, these past few days have been tough for us, and I know we’ve been facing challenges that have made us both question things. I want you to know that no matter what, my love for you has never wavered. If I’ve seemed different lately, it’s not because my feelings have changed—it’s because I’ve been trying to navigate my own thoughts and emotions, sometimes clumsily, but always with you at the center of everything. Every word, every action, even the silly or stupid ones, come from a place of deep love for you. I am so comfortable with you that I sometimes forget to filter myself, and for that, I am sorry. But please know, it’s only because you are my safe space, my home.<br><br>
            I love you more than words can ever express. You are the one I want to wake up next to every morning, the one I want to hold hands with until my last breath. You are the person I see in my future, in every dream, in every plan. I want to build a life with you, filled with laughter, understanding, and endless love. I want to be the man who makes you proud, who supports you, and who loves you unconditionally through every high and low.<br><br>
            Today, on Valentine’s Day, I want to remind you of how much you mean to me. You are my everything, Saba. My love for you is as vast as the sky and as deep as the ocean. Every moment with you is a treasure, and I want to spend the rest of my life making you feel as loved and cherished as you deserve to be.<br><br>
            Please forgive me for any mistakes I’ve made, for any moments I’ve made you doubt my love. I promise to do better, to be better, because you are worth every effort. You are my heart, my soul, my forever.<br><br>
            With all my love, today and always,<br>
            taki
